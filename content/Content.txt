I'm a U.S. Army veteran with 12 years of service, now building a new chapter as a technical professional and web developer—combining discipline, leadership, and hands-on skills across multiple industries. My career began as a carpenter in Hawaii (2000–2002), and after enlisting in 2002, I served until 2014, developing a strong work ethic, strategic planning abilities, and problem-solving under pressure.

Since relocating to Florida in 2017, I've pursued a wide range of technical certifications to expand my expertise:

- **AutoCAD Certification** – Erwin Technical College (2018–2020)  
- **HVAC/R Certification** – Erwin Technical College (2020–2021)  
- **Plumbing Certification** – Erwin Technical College (2021–2022)  
- **Logistics Certification** – Brewster Technical College (2022–2023)  
- **Carpentry Certification** – Erwin Technical College (2023–2024)

I worked as an **Installation Process Manager** at Renewal by Andersen Florida until September 2025, where I led installation workflows, coordinated teams, and drove continuous improvement in residential projects.

Currently, I'm enrolled in the **Web Development program at Brewster Technical College**, where I'm building skills in front-end and back-end technologies including HTML, CSS.

As a bilingual communicator (English/Spanish), I collaborate effectively with multicultural teams and adapt to diverse environments in both the U.S. and Colombia. My goal is to integrate my technical background and leadership experience into digital projects that are functional, inspiring, and built to solve real-world challenges.
